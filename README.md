# Hangman-python-
The Hangman Game in Python is about guessing letters (A-Z) to form the words. If the player guesses the right letter that is within the word, the letter appears at its correct position. The user has to guess the correct word until a man is hung, then the game is over; if guessed before the lives exhaust then the player wins!

implemented it with:
1] Python programming language
2] Python modules used (random and time)
3] Python loops and functions are enough to build this game.
